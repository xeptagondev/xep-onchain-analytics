        Due to the nature of a Blockchain network, cryptocurrencies are becoming the preferred option

        With the number of cybercriminal activities on the rise, members of the network would want to detect 
        these criminals as soon as possible to prevent them from harming the networkâ€™s community and integrity. 
        In financial networks, thieves and illegal activities are often anomalous in nature. Hence, we will be
